<br>

### PROBLEM SETTING:

Music genre and recommendation are important for creating a personalized and enjoyable listening experience for users. By understanding an individual's preferences and recommending music based on those preferences, music services can create a unique listening experience for each user. Music genre and recommendation also help users discover new music that they may not have otherwise found, as well as organize their music library. Additionally, music genre and recommendation play an important role in marketing for the music industry by promoting new music and expanding audiences. Overall, music genre and recommendation benefit both users and the music industry by creating a personalized and organized listening experience while also promoting new music and expanding audiences.

### PROBLEM DEFINITION:
Music is a powerful and universal form of communication that connects people from all walks of life, transcending language and cultural barriers. It has the ability to evoke strong emotions and bring back memories, serving as a source of comfort and escape. The vast and diverse musical landscape can be overwhelming, making it challenging for music lovers to discover new pieces to enjoy.
Music genre classification helps in navigating this landscape by grouping music into different genres, providing a roadmap for listeners. This allows them to explore new artists, styles, and compositions with ease and can also assist in narrowing down choices when searching for music that matches their current mood or taste.
In this project, we take a unique approach to music recommendations and genre classification, involving the use of acoustic features extracted from raw music through digital signal processing methods to make predictions, without considering the user's music profile. This approach aims to provide music lovers with a valuable framework for discovering new and exciting pieces to enjoy, no matter what their mood or taste. In conclusion, music genre classification plays a crucial role in helping music enthusiasts navigate the musical landscape and find the perfect fit.
